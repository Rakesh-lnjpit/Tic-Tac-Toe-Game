# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
its a game of 9 boxes in which one who first completed sequentialy either column,row ,diagonal then he will be won the game.
basic idea about this is we firstly find all the sequence for winning sequences.

| 0 1 2 |

| 3 4 5 |

| 6 7 8 |

now, the winning sequences are:
{ 
[0,1,2]
[3,4,5]
[6,7,8]
[0,3,6]
[1,4,7]
[2,5,8]
[0,4,8]
[2,4,6]
}
these all 8 sequences are the main concept for this tic-tac-toe game.
